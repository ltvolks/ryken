    	<p>Ryan Hicks, D.C., is a native midwesterner from Rockford, IL.  He did his undergraduate studies at the University of Iowa.  He then went on to earn his Doctorate degree in Chiropractic from Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, IA.  Palmer College is the original and most recognized chiropractic college in the world. </p>
    	<p>In 2005, Dr. Ryan had the opportunity of a lifetime, to go on a clinic abroad trip to Fiji with a group of fellow chiropractic graduate students.  There he and the other student chiropractors helped hundreds of underprivledged children and adults.  There he was able to see first hand the body's innate ability to heal with chiropractic care.  He plans to travel there again sometime soon.</p>
    	<p>Dr. Ryan has advanced knowledge in many chiropractic techniques and is able to use that knowledge to find the right combination for each patient's individual needs.  His goal is to not only help people <em>get</em> well, but to help people <em>stay</em> well.</p>
